# Advanced-SASS-CSS-Course
Here I showcase some skills I learnt from an advanced SASS course by Jonas Schmedtmann

## In total the whole course was 28 hours long.

There was three main projects. Natours, Nexter and Trillo.
Here are some pictures of the work I completed, if you want to enjoy the full experience of the applications then feel free to clone the projects to see all of the interactive animations.

# Natours
In this application I learnt a lot about SASS and advanced responsive design!
